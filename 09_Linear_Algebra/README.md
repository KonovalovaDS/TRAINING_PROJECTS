### Project description

The goal of the project is to build a regression model that predicts gas production at a well based on other well characteristics, and interpret the results of the model.

The Project is split into two parts:

- At first, to build a simple linear regression model using only Numpy library ('manual' approach) and using Sklearn library ('automatic' approach), analyze both approaches results, and select the most significant factors for forecasting.

- In the second, to build a polynomial regression model with regularization and look at the final modeling results.

### Dataset

**Data Features**

- Well — well identifier;

- Por — well porosity (%);

- Perm — well permeability;

- AI — acoustic impedance ($kg/m^2 * 10^6$);

- Brittle — well brittleness coefficient (%);

- TOC — total organic carbon (%);

- VR — vitrinite reflectivity (%);

- Prod — daily gas production (million cubic feet) - Target.

### Conclusion

The best results have been achieved with the Linear Regression Model on Polynomial Features with L1 - Lasso regularization.
