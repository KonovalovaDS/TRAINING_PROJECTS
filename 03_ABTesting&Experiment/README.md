## Project description
### - Analysis of A / B testing Results 
A tourist company plans to launch a new prmotion to sell as many tours as possible. The team developed two versions of company's official website and conducted A/B testing. The task is to analyze the effectivness of both variants of website by two criteria: purchase conversion and average check, make the conclusion which of the website design is preferable. 
The company offers the tours to the following destinations with corresponding price tag:

- Thailand - 100.000 RUR
- Turkiye - 60.000 RUR
- Maldives - 200.000 RUR
- St.Petersburg - 10.000 RUR
- Kamchatka - 150.000 RUR

### - Logging Experiment
The target of the project is to learn how to run and logging the experiment & corresponding metrics via Comet ML web-service. It is necessary tool while developing ML-model using various parameters in order to keep track of updated and improved model metrics. 
To use dataset, please use the below code:
```python
url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/11sgquDFg1cSfm-j3i1XtyCl2eNO5dcYb/view?usp=sharing'

path = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id='+url.split('/')[-2]

data = pd.read_csv(path, compression = 'zip')
```
