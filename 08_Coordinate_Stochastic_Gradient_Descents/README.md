### Project description

The target of the project is to build coordinate descent using Numpy library and compare the results with the outcomes received by using Linear Regression Model algorithm from Sklearn. Also the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm was implemented using only Numpy library in order to compare the results and to see which algorithm performs / shows better results.

### Dataset

The data set contains the information on expenses spent for advertisment on TV, radio and using newspapers and the target feature: amount of sales that each means of advertisment generated. Data set doesn't contain any missing or duplicate rows; it is ready to use for building the model(s).

### Conclusion

The Stochastic Gradient Descent showed the better result compare to Coordinate Desvcent.

|**Algorithm**|**Results**|
|:--|:--|
|Coordinate Descent 'manual'|41.56 / 110.13 / 73.53 / -0.55|
|Coordinate Descent 'sklearn'|41.56 / 110.13 / 73.53 / -0.55|
|Stochastic Gradient Descent|14.02 / 4.06 / 2.94 / 1.20|
