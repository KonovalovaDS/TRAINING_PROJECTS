## <p align="center"> Project description </p>

The company "Booking.com" is facing the problem - dishonest hotels that wind up their rating. One way to discover such hotels is to create a ML-model that predicts the rating of the specific hotel. If the prediction of the model is very different from the actual result, then the hotel might behave dishnestly and is worth to be checked.

The main target of the project is to see that thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis can increase the accuracy of the ML-model significantly. 

To assess the quality of the ML-model, MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) has been calculated. The resut is 12%. Calculations and metrics were logged with Comet ML.
