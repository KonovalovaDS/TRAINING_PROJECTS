### Project description

The goal of the project is to implement the classification of spam messages using manually created codes and sklearn library functions, and compare the results.

The following Sklearn Bayes Classificators are used:

- MultinomialNB classificator, becasue it works with text and unbalanced data sets; and
- ComplementNB classificator since it is improved version of MultinomialNB.

### Conclusion

Manually created algorithms and implementing Sklearn libraries show approximately the same results. This exercise helps to understand in details the priciples of Naive Baeys algorithms performance.
